// For JUnit testing, focus on testing methods that can be tested independently of the GUI.
// This includes methods responsible for game logic and data manipulation, such as updating the snake's position,
// regenerating the apple, and checking for collisions.
// I'll write tests to ensure these methods behave as expected under various conditions.

//Future Improvement:s
//Modularization: Refactor the code to separate concerns and adhere to a more structured design pattern like MVC (Model-View-Controller) to improve maintainability and scalability.
//Enhanced Gameplay: Add features such as increasing speed over time, adding obstacles, or power-ups to make the game more challenging and engaging.
//User Interaction: Implement functionality for pausing/resuming the game, restarting the game, or displaying the score to enhance user experience.
